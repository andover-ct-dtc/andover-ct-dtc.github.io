Julia moved to Andover in 1969.  She was happy living here right from the start.  Howard and Rachel Stanley were her only close neighbors.  Soon Howard invited her to attend a town meeting telling her, "Itâ€™s better than TV!"  She happily accepted his invitation.  That was the beginning of many years of serving on town boards and commissions.  She was First Selectman when the "new firehouse" was approved, and worked on the committee to approve the Long Hill Ball Field.  She is running currently to serve an unexpired term on the Board of Assessment Appeals.
