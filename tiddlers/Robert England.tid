Robert has a BA in History from Trinity College.  He and his family moved to Andover in 2007.  He is currently a member of the Board of Finance re-elected in 2021.  Robert understands his critical role in Andover.  His goal is to balance town needs which he says are many; schools, roads/culverts/trees, the community center, and the issue of the townâ€™s savings balance about to be depleted.

Robert has excellent problem-solving skills. He is analytical, impartial, considerate, and efficient, all traits critical for a Board of Finance member.  Robert's children went through Andover Elementary and are now in 10th grade and 7th grade at RHAM.
