!! November 4 - A Day to Vote and Give Back

!!! Andover Democrats and Republicans stand united in support of our community.

The recent end of federal SNAP benefits will place an additional burden on local Andover families, seniors, and veterans that are already struggling to make ends meet.  On Election Day, November 4, we are asking residents to not only make their voices heard at the ballot box -- but also to lend a hand to those in need.

Please consider bringing a donation for the Andover Food Pantry with you on Election Day.  There will be a collection table near the Republican and Democratic tents.

This is a moment to remember what unites us: compassion, community, and care for our neighbors.

Together we can make November 4th a true day of community support!
