Anne is a retired teacher and has lived in Andover for 18 years.  She is Vice Chair of the Planning and Zoning Commission, serving because she wants to help Andover move ahead.

> "A great thing about Andover is that a person's vote can make a difference.  Still, we also need to be involved in our town to make it the best it can be."

Anne is calm and quiet, but with a steely reserve.  She listens well to everyone in town and will be a voice of reason where hot-headedness too often prevails. 

Anne will bring respect and consideration to the Board of Selectmen, which currently needs a degree of humility.
