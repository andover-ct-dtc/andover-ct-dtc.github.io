  "Linda L. Armstrong": "Too short. No personal notes or political experience listed.",
  "Brian Briggs": "This one is great.  It could serve as a model for others.  But the photo should be a headshot.",
  "Anne CrÃ¨me": "This is not really a political bio.  It's also argumentative.  Fine for the Rivereast, but probably not here (or in a brochure.)",
  "Patrick Dougherty": "This is merely a placeholder.  We need a biography.",
  "Louise Goodwin": "Too short.  And \"we're happy to endorse...\" probably does not belong",
  "Caitlin Greenhouse": "This is a fine biography.  If there's any political experience, we should list it.",
  "Kim Hawes": "A little short.  And \"we're lucky to have her as a candidate\" is probably out of place here",
  "Shannon Louden": "Far too short",
  "Scott Sauyet": "This one is fine.  (Okay, so I wrote it; sue me! ðŸ˜ƒ)",
  "Emily Timrick": "This one is great for the website.  For a brochure, we might need to remove the bottom bullet list.",
  "John Tyczkowski": "I think this one is successfully reduced from his rÃ©sumÃ©-style entry.  But he will need to review."
