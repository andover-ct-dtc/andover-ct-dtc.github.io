title: Understanding the Data
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

To make changes to this page, we need to understand how it's structured.  We have a few simple data structures.  

The simplest is `Party`.  Anything tagged `Party` is understood to be a political party.  These contain only a name, the tag "Party" and an `allied` field containing "yes", "sometimes", or "no".
